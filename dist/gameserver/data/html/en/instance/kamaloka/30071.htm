<html><head>Captain Lucas:<br>
Welcome, young friend. Welcome to Dion! I am Lucas, the man responsible for the security of Dion. Is this your first time to Dion? I dont't know what brought you here, but bear in mind that this is a quiet and law-abiding town. I don't tolerate anyone looking only to disturb the peace!<br>
When you decide to leave, be warned that there are a number of dangerous areas outside the town. I'd advise that you venture out only in a group. Have a nice stay!<br>
