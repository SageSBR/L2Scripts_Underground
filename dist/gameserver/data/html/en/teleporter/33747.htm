<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br>
I am the 2nd generation Spicula that awakened after hearing the giant's voice. I function by twisting dimensions and connecting them through the use of runes. This allows me to move you instantly between different dimensions.<br>
I provide this function for a nominal fee to <font color="LEVEL">the Awakened</font> who can access the high-dimensional rune language. The fee will be used to purchase the gold that is required to resurrect my master's body. If you are an Awakened, you may use me for your convenience.<br>
