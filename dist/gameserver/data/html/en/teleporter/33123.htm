Hello! I Raykel, answer here for Teleport.<br>
Those who first visited Talking Island, I suggest to make the expedition.<br>
Especially those who want to get into the ruins Esagira. You must first visit the ruins of their own. After you can use Teleport.<br>
And if you need to Aden, track down the Milli around the Museum.<br>
