<html><body>Dimension Keeper:<br>
Hello! Hello, my name Spicule, I woke up from the voice of the Giants, and my mission is their resurrection. Using the power of runes, I briefly distort space. In other words, allow you to instantly move to another location. I help Spicules that are looking for the body of a Giant.<br>
For a small fee I provide this service and&nbsp;<font color="LEVEL">inbred soldiers</font>that can use high runes measurements. The money will be used to purchase gold for the restoration of the host body. I recommend You to use my teleport! Unless of course You already reborn.<br>
