<html><head>Administrator Subclassing / Dual Class Drandum:<br>
To master the skill of double class is not easy. <br1>
Forget about past accomplishments, the new class - not the last. Now everything will be much more difficult. <br1>
I will use special herbs to once again impose a stamp on skills already mastered. <br1>
Price herbs - <font color="LEVEL"> 20 million adena </font>. Grass is always available, so you only have to pay and I at any time to make the abolition of certification. <br1>
If you cancel the certification <font color="LEVEL"> all certified skills that are now available to disappear, and the certificates are deleted. </font> <br1>
Well, cancel the certification?<br>
