Fishing Guild Member Willie:<br>
Much like the Ivory Tower, Oren has long been a magnet for the intelligentsia!<br>
Therefore, many folks here enjoy fishing in their free time! You'll often find them sitting quietly at their favorite fishing spot, engrossed in their thoughts, waiting for a fish to bite. Some are so engrossed in their daydreams that after a few hours they end up not catching anything at all!<br>
