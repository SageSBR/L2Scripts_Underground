Pet Manager Saroyan:<br>
Did you want a pet? Sorry, didn't mean to startle you! I just have a habit of observing my customers' expressions carefully.
As the number of people who interested in raising pets increases these days, the number of people who neglect or abuse their pets is sadly also increasing. I simply want to examine my customers carefully in order to protect my animals. Please don't take it personally!<br>
