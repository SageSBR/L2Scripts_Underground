<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Pochi:<br>
Welcome! Do you wish to deposit your items? Or perhaps you would like your items back? Well, well. Say, have you been to that shop nearby that specializes in luxury items? No? Oh, you should! Its owner is Galladucci, a Dwarf like me. He may strike you as a little odd, but he's got a keen eye for unique, high-quality items. If you stop by, tell him I sent you -- you won't regret it!<br>
