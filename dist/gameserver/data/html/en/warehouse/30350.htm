<html><body>The Caretaker Of The Warehouse Carlon:<br>
How are things in the village of the Dark Elves? I really care about the welfare of this nation. The dark Elves so desperately fought to stop the monsters Shillien... Must be the village it is not easy to get. At such times all the more useful to do reserves for a rainy day. If You have accumulated too much baggage, leave it to me. Be assured, I'll take care of her.<br>
