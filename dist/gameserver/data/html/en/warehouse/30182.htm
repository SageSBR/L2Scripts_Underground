<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br>
Come in, come in! My, that looks heavy! Just put it down here...<br>
This secure warehouse is managed by the Dwarf Bank Union. Once you deposit your item here, only you or the person you designate can withdraw it. Trust and security are our motto. Have you ever heard of an item stolen from a warehouse managed by Dwarf? Of course not!<br>
Best of all, you can deposit an item here and withdraw it from one of our locations in a completely different city. Think of the convenience!<br>
