Coins for Iron Gate can be <font color="LEVEL">buy weapons / armor / accessories of any rank</font>. Equipment has limitations for options or elements enchantments exchange also possible, but is it so important? Much more importantly, you will have the right equipment.<br>
And do not worry about what to do with obsolete items. <font color="LEVEL">If I bring unnecessary gear, I will exchange it for the Iron Gate Coins</font>, for which you buy the right equipment. Cool? Of the items you can donate to the recovery of Aden. Or play me in a game of chance. Behind the Iron Chest Arms and Chest iron armor can sometimes get weapons and armor Requiem, Apocalypse and Specter.<br>
