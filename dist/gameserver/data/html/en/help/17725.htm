Letter from Parliament:
<br>
Poor travelers lost village.
<br>
Welcome! I <font color="LEVEL">Head of Delegation Magmelda Parliament</font>.
The once beautiful and peaceful our village were
devastated by the disease, which caused rotting body and
bone. I gather like-minded people to
try to find the cause of this misfortune.
<br>
I think that you are well prepared to
join us, so send it
letter.
<br>
Will you help us?
