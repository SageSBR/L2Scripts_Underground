Member of the Guild of Travelers:<br>
Our guild is collecting information about what is happening in the world, and sends it to interested travelers. As they say, knowledge - force.<br>
When Benon only appeared in Guild Travelers added work. We knew nothing about the world of the spirits of the wind, so it was difficult to obtain information. Had to ask themselves Artey.<br>
