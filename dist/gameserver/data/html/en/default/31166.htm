<html><head>Pet elite trainer:<br>
I've spent my whole life training hatchlings and striders. My Lord, I'll take care of your dragon so he will be able to deserve you and satisfy your expectations. I will summon a creature from the seven sphere for this ceremony, you have to know that this is a dangerous ritual and your pet can be harmed or even die, the results will depend on his fortress.<br>
