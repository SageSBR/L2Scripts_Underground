High Priest Gereth:<br>
Tower Saihi is a place where it can be accessed. And Saiha always listen to you.<br>
When I was in the world of Spirits of the Wind, I always asked Saihi of the Board, if in Benon something happened.<br>
When we were in the material world, I was glad that the Tower Saihi was not injured. Now I no longer hear the voice Saihi, and that bothers me. But I firmly believe that he has not left us.<br>
