Ancient Book of the Demon symbolizes the loyalty and devotion of tamed monsters to Belew. I really don't know what's written in an ancient language, something to do with the Treaty of Beliefa. I'm doing a useful collection of ancient books and the destruction of the threat. This book must be destroyed, although there are no guarantees that it will release the tamed monsters...<br>
