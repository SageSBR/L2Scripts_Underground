<html><head>Master Talbot:<br>
Welcome, comrade! Those who follow the path of the sword are all comrades, eh?<br>
Just remember that. All those who possess the same goal are comrades, forging a bond that will never fade away! Follow this creed and it will serve you well as you confront the confusion and nastiness of the world. 
Forget it and you will have trouble...<br>
