Seed Talisman Manager:<br>
	<br>
Gracia is interesting, yes, interesting for its seeds. Many seeds, very interesting!
	<br>
We have found, let me see... Talisman of Infinity, Talisman of Destruction, Talisman of Annihilation, Talisman of Hellfire, Talisman of Desire, and Talisman of Longing! My favorite, yes, is the Talisman of Longing, but for you I can only offer the Talisman of Infinity. 
	<br>
But don't worry, no! With <font color="LEVEL">Energy of Destruction</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Energy of Giant</font>, you can create a Seed Talisman beyond that of Destruction! It does not always work, of course, but it is worth trying, yes! 
	<br>
Only one Talisman has effect at a time. All Talismans are bound to you, but you can unbind the Talisman of Longing by sealing it.
