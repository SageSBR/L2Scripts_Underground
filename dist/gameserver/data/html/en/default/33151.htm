Are you really ready, physically and mentally? Do not underestimate Istina's power, especially here on her home turf.<br>
If you still believe you have a chance, we will help you by weaking Istina with the magical power Ballista.<br>
Istina's creative power is generated by the soul stone in her body. Regular attack won't even screatch the soul stone, but by concentracting your magical power into a huge attack with the Ballista, we can damage her. Also, do you have the <font color="LEVEL">Energy Controller</font>? You will need it for this fight. I will give you more details once you are inside the cavern. Are you ready to enter now?<br>
