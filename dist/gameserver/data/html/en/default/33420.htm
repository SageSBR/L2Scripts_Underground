<html><head>Questionable Dye Merchant Diania:<br>
Hey you, adventurer! Yes, I mean you.<br>
Perhaps are you looking for good quality dyes that can be used to dye symbols? I have plenty. The only catch is, <font color="LEVEL">if you purchase one, it will be randomly chosen from my selection.</font><br>
I have plain dyes and rare dyes, but I can guarantee that it will be of high quality. What do you say?<br>
