<html><head>Guillotine Fortress Warden Roderik:<br>
I'm here to watch the Guillotine Fortress. I've been sending scouting reports to Dion but they don't appreciate what I do. The real reason I'm here is that I'm sort of an alarm system.<br>
As long as they keep receiving my reports, they think things can't be that bad here, because I'm not dead. So when I stop sending reports... the aristocrats in Dion will have to react..<br>
