Since the conclusion of the Alliance between Gracia and Adenomas study Seed Gracia is progressing rapidly. In particular, a few seeds managed to find the talismans.<br>
We found the Talisman of Immortality, Talisman of Destruction, bringer of Destruction, the Talisman, Fire Talisman, the Talisman of Desire and Talisman made of Gilded Wood. But I can only give the Talisman of Immortality. Do not worry You so! With <font color="LEVEL">the Energy of Destruction</font> and <font color="LEVEL">the Power of the Giants</font> , you can create much more powerful Talisman Seed than Talisman of Destruction. Of course, failure is also possible. So when you want to level up, do it carefully. Ha! But remember that if you use while increasing the level of <font color="LEVEL">Energy Carly</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Elysium</font>, it is possible to avoid failures or to increase the chance of success.<br>
If You use multiple mascots, the effect will still be as one.<br>Oh yeah! I can't help only in creating the Mascot of Gilded Wood. You can get it if you use <font color="LEVEL">the Connection objects</font> in the inventory. But to get it will be not so easy, this is a very rare item.<br>
Mascot Seed all of You will return. You can seal the Mascot of Lust and Talisman made of Gilded Wood, to pass it on to someone else.<br>
