Welcome, Adventurer!<br>
You have completed a most difficult battle, and I was dispatched from the Adventurer Guild to offer you help. Do you have a Mark of Seal of an Adventurer? If you have marks, I will exchange them for seals, some of which can be exchanged for useful items. Remember, I can only carry out one exchange per person.<br>
I can only accept "Mark of an Adventurer - Spirit" - if you have other marks or seals, you will have to find another guildsman.<br>
