On your way here, did you see red rocks towering from the ground? They are so huge that you can even see them from here. We sealed some of them with the help of some Dwarves, but most of them remain unsealed. Some of them also appear and then disappear. They are the 'Spicula Clone Generator Yin'. They are evidence that Nornil's defense system is now affecting this area too. And the places that are the most affected by the defense system are <font color="LEVEL">Nornil's Cave</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Nornil's Garden</font> where <font color="LEVEL">Spicula Clone Generator Boz</font> is. I heard Boz creates more Spiculas when it sees intruders or gets attacked.<br>
