Blacksmith Ivni:<br>
If you need a Dual Swords contact Ivni! I can do anything other than swords <font color="LEVEL">grade A</font>! Only beats me ... Perhaps only the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>?<br>
If you bring a sword and a stone of purity as payment, it will be enough, and I will prepare you for the Dual Swords.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Simple weapons</font> combined with simple weapons <font color="LEVEL">common </font> combined with conventional, and only <font color="LEVEL">rare weapons</font> and can be combined with a simple and with little arms. That's done Dual Swords. Rare weapons-grade below B in the world does not occur.<br>
Swords with different abilities can not be combined, so they are useless.<br>
Also remember that the modification of weapons after the unification disappears!<br>
