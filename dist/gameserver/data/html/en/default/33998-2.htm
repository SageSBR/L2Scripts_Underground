Want to add your weapons special properties?<br>
A modification do not worry. Special properties do not depend on the modification and do not affect it. Information about the new options appear at the bottom. Of course, this only applies to the weapons you use.<br>
Note also that for Grade A and gear up I would not venture to undertake. This is a job for the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>.<br>
By the way, if you suddenly want <font color="LEVEL">delete</font> <font color="LEVEL">special properties</font>, You will also need help <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>. You can even try to talk to <font color="LEVEL">Smuggler Mammon</font>... It seems that he is also able to remove <font color="LEVEL">special properties</font>.<br>
Well, choose how you want to improve your weapon!<br>
