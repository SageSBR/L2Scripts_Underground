In this world every thing is possible to find the application. Do you agree? Sometimes we don't even realize that the stored... am I right?<br1>
Now we need to restore the destroyed area. Some things that were considered normal trinkets, now in the afternoon with fire not to find, because they have become building material. If You bring me unnecessary trophies, I'll exchange them for the Treasure Chest. Maybe he'll come in handy. Naturally, You will have to pay a Commission...<br>
Ask what the trophies? Inspect your inventory. Maybe there is something lying around. Do You happen to have the usual materials of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd level? Or at least crystals?<br>
