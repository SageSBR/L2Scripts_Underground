Gracian Survivor:<br>
I understand Your mood, but Gracia is not such a simple place. I'm sorry, but Your abilities are not enough. You will become easy prey for our enemies.<br>
In Aden too many monsters. Gain some experience first at them and then go to Gracia.<br>
(In Gracia can be reached only characters above level 75.)
