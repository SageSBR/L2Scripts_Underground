Tombstone of the Guillotine of Death:<br>
(This is the grave of the executed leaders of the peasant uprising. By order of Baron Ashton all family members sentenced were stoned to death and buried here. However, they were revived by drinking the blood of Shillien. The tomb is empty, leaving only this tombstone.)
