Shh! Please hush. Behind me is <font color="LEVEL">the old town</font>, it is the only entrance to the Steel Citadel. Now it's a camp for prisoners.<br>
Not so long ago, when Steel Citadel temporarily weakened our defense, we attacked the city, to rescue the captives. However, the enemies were very strong and many of us were killed or wounded.<br>
And our comrades in the city are still waiting for the release!<br>
