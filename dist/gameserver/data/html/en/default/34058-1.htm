Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:<br>
Hush! Want to know what are we doing here? Once we got here, it means that the situation requires!<br>
You know that originally it was the site of the dark elves? However, recently the area has changed a lot. Vanguard secretly arrived from Aden to find out what happened here. Arriving here, we found that the Embryo has built a huge fortress. Looks like they were serious. <br>
We are going to capture the Fortress of Astatine and find out what you're up to Embryo. Other members of the avant-Garde now take positions around the fortress.<br>
