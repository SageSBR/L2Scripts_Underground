If You take a left from the entrance to the city, we drive into an area of warehouses and retail stores.<br>
Right live settlers from the Village of Elves.<br>
On the hill you can see the Tower of the Ancient Arcana. There lived a brave warrior from a tribe of cats - Slake!<br>
Oh and lastly... In the centre is the Central axis that supports the city. But recently 
she spews dark energy and strange creatures. They don't allow You to get closer to this place.
