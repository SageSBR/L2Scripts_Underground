Dejakyar Paagrio!<br>
One who holds the flame close to heart, welcome. I, Lazenby, am prepared to teach you skills in order to further the prestige of the flame.<br>
There are not only adventurers seeking treasure in this village, but also various races and organizations that pass through here. I can't allow a naive child of flame to roam around and bring disgrace to the name of Paagrio!<br>
