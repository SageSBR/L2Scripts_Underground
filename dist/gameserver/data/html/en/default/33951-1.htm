Managing Forests Saruviya:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As soon as we were in the material world</font>, Fierce monsters attacked our village - Benon. Queen Sereni and Callie Sereban desperately fought with them, not retreat a single step. And along with them - <font color="LEVEL">Tazif</font>...<br>
Terrible battle was in full swing. Many soldiers lost their lives and connected to Sihem.<br>
Such was the price of victory. We must not forget Artey soldiers who sacrificed themselves in the name of Benon.<br>
