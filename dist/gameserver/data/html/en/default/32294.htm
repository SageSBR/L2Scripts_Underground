All of the monsters have been tamed by Belafon. I'm looking for a way to free them, but it is not easy. His power is backed by the power of the Ancient Book of the Demon.<br>
If You bring me <font color="LEVEL">a Sealed Ancient Book of Demon</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Bloody an Ancient Book of the Demon</font>, I'll exchange them for something very useful.<br>
