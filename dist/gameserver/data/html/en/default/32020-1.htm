I think you can improve this course, connecting the accessories of Freyja, Queen Ants, Orfen, Antharas and Valakas with their souls. If You agree to this, still disappear, but You will get a new one. If <font color="LEVEL">You are in any way strengthened items, new items, these improvements will not work</font>.<br>
It suits you? Then I'll put soul in Your subject.<br>
