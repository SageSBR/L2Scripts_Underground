This Device can Move instantly transfer You to the base! Amazing, isn't it?<br>
It was invented by Mrs. Elric from Camp Blackbeard. If You plan to stay here, it might be helpful. Here, take.<br>
However, Elric said that the design has significant flaws, so the time of operation of the device is relatively small. It is only 24 hours...<br>
However, don't worry, we've got these devices fully. If it breaks, come, I will give You a new one.<br>
