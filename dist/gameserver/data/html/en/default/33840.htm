Flame Patrol Warrior Bruener:<br>Hey, my friend. What are you doing here?<br><br>
I can't guarantee your safety if you venture too far.<br>Of course, you will always be safe with the Noble Orcs and me, Flame Patrol Warrior Bruener. The Noble Orcs are protected by Pa'agrio, and I am a warrior selected by Kakai the Lord of Flame.<br>
Hahahahahaha!<br>
