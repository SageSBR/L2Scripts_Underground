What brings You to such a dangerous place? You're not the enemy, right?<br>
Came to learn from me fighting techniques? I'm afraid You chose is not the right time.<br>
I'm actually trying to ambush arranged. Hmm!<br>
We observe the actions of Embryonic and try to regularly make the attack on their base.<br>
Recently, however, their strength is suddenly increased, so I had to hide... to prepare a new plan of attack. But You came and helped us regain control of the base. Excellent!<br>
