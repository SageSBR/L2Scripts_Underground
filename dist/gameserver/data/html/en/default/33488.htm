Thank you for helping Hermuncus.<br>
His spirit is free but we now need to find the remnants of his bodyâ€¦ only then may we be able to resurrect him. I have
been waiting for you here in the <font color="LEVEL">Reliquary of the Giants</font> as commanded by Hermuncus. Ask me
anything and I will answer.<br>
