Who's there?! Enemy or friend? Reply!<br>
However, if You were the enemy probably would not have come so close. Therefore, You are not the enemy. Why did You come to such a dangerous place? Don't tell me You drew my beauty...<br>
Hmm, no kidding. You've probably already heard that we have been able to take a position in the Fortress of Astatine. What? If I was in captivity? No, no... I just wanted to secretly sneak into the enemy base... heh heh Heh...<br>
Anyway, your help has helped us to regain control of the base. I guess I have to reward You.<br>
