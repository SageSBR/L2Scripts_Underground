High Priest Gereth:<br>
I am a Priest Gereth, a Minister Saihi. For my devotion, I received from him a special blessing.<br>
Now I can't hear the voice Saihi, but he could not leave us. Someday, I'm sure I'll hear his voice.<br>
In the meantime, we must pass through the trials which he sends us.<br>
