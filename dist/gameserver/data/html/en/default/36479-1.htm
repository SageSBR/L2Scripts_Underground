If you're eligible, tell me what you want.<br>
You can enchant <font color="LEVEL">Top-Grade</font> weapons and armors that are <font color="LEVEL">A-grade or better</font> to be specialized for PvP. Weapons must be <font color="LEVEL">bestowed with special abilities</font>... And one an item is enchanted, it can <font color="LEVEL">only be used by its owner</font>.<br>
Consider carefully before specializing an item for PvP as <font color="LEVEL">enchant scrolls may still be used on it. Augmenting, soul storing, attribute assigning or conversion to a Kamael weapon is not allowed</font>. And <font color="LEVEL">you can't enchant R-grade armor to PvP armor</font>. You should also know that <font color="LEVEL">bound armor of all grade cannot be enchanted to PvP armor</font>.
