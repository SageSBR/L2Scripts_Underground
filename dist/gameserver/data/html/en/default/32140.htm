Vice Hierarch Zenya:<br>
I am Vice Hierarch Zenya. I assist the Hierarch and watch over you, our young Kamael warriors, who are leaving the safety of our little nest.<br>
Now that the seal on the Kamael has been broken and other races come in and out of the village as they please, I am concerned that the Kamael who leave this place will forget our ancient traditions and customs. Certainly they are very different from those of the outside world...<br>
Do not forget! Cling tightly to the skills, the culture and the spirit of the Kamael.<br>
