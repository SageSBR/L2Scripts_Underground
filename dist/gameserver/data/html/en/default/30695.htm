Hey, welcome to the Mystics Guild of Hunters Village. This village may look calm and peaceful, but dreadful secrets lurk around here. For instance, there is a group of Assassins who would even kill the royal family if they were paid.<br>
Shh! Don't tell this to anyone else. Do you think one of the Assassins would let you live after hearing that?<br>
Well... No more gossiping...<br>
