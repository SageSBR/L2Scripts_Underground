Anita managed trade:<br>
Glad to see you, the traveler.<br1>I managed trade of the kingdom of Aden. Do you know anything about the commission trade?<br>
In a nutshell, here you can buy a lot of goods from all over the continent.<br1>Of course, if you, the traveler, there are things to buy, you can take them to us.<br>
If payment of the prescribed fee at the time of product registration, you can register the product cheaper.<br1>And another plus: <font color="LEVEL">Commission for the sale of goods is automatically charged after the completion of the transaction.</font><br>
Well? Try to use my services?<br>
