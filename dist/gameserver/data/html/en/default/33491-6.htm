I knew that Artie very curious, but... This stone is not a toy! You know he can absorb the power of the owner? One wrong move and You will certainly perish! <br>
On the other hand, he will give You the opportunity to use the power of the Giants...<br>
Without the help of the stone, this is absolutely impossible, because Artie belong to a different world! But You have to remember that the strength of the Giants and force Arta cannot be used simultaneously. You have to choose one or the other.<br>
Well? I wish to receive the power of the Giants?<br>
