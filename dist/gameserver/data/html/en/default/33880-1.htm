<html><body>Monk of Chaos:<br>
The monks of Chaos... They worship Chaos and his incarnation, Gran Cain.<br>
A widespread opinion according to which the Chaos - the element of death and mindless destruction, but it is not. The chaos balance the light and darkness that allows them to turn one into the other. He destroys, but he also creates. We chose the path of service to the world order as embodied in <font color="LEVEL">the Chaos</font>.<br>
We, the monks of Chaos, recognize the will of our Lord and ready to serve his purposes.
