Who's there?! Oh, I thought it was the enemy. I'm sorry. There is dangerous, so extra caution wouldn't hurt.<br>
Did you see what happened? We were defending the base, to spare no effort. However, at some point it seemed to me that all is lost, so these Embryo raged!<br>
I will not forget Your help. For such bravery You a reward!<br>
