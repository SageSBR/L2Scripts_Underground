Mysterious Agent:<br>
Greetings again. Don't worry, these mates are friends of mine, they won't hurt if you will be peaceful.<br>
We have the proposition for you and your friends. None of us here likes Darion, the General of Beleth, but we're bound with the contract which Beleth has signed with us.<br>
You know... we want to <font color="LEVEL">kill General Darion</font>. But we can't! And I think this is the right moment to offer you this mission. Face and destroy <font color="LEVEL">Darion, the General of Beleth</font>!<br>
If you accept this offer, I will grant you with powerful support magic agaist Darion.<br>
So, what you say ? <br>
