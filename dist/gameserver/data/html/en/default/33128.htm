I saw the beautiful creatures, the likes of which have not seen ever before! It was really an unforgettable sight!<br>
Rada, the head of our delegation, bored and constantly start talking about going back. Willy-nilly, I had to obey, but I intend to spend more time in Magmelde when I go there next time.<br>
Hmm? You ask, what is the Magmeld? Do you really have not heard anything about him?<br>
