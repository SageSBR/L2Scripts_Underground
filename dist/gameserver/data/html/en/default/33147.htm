<html><body>Cocoon:<br>
Through the thin shape shows how mutates Citizen of the fairies.<br>
It seems that the cocoon can be broken by hitting it.<br>
And, you can pour in <font color="LEVEL">Mica</font> and thus boost the mutation.<br>
(To use <font color="LEVEL">Mica</font>, select Cocoon and click on the Mica. If you want to break the Cocoon, hit him while holding "Ctrl". 
To improve the efficiency of impact use attacking skills.)
