Yes, our base is located closest to the entrance, but this does not mean that it is safer than others. Even here it is possible to encounter Embryo.<br>
Mrs. Elric from the Camp of Blackburrow invented special Devices Move, that this could have been avoided. If You plan to stay with us, such a device is very useful to You.<br>
True, Mrs. Elric had no time to develop them, so they work only 24 hours. Remember this!<br>
If Your device will cease to operate, come to me, I will give You more.<br>
