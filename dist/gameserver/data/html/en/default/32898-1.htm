<html><body>Gray Pillar Kantarubis:<br>
Mica - jellylike substance in which materialized vital energy. It 
found only on this side of the world.<br>
Depending on the circumstances it can be the source of life, to serve food or to exchange for goods like money. 
Amazing, isn't it?<br>
Before it was to be mined in large quantities in the habitats of fairies, but after all these disasters to get the Mica was not easy.
