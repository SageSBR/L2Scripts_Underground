Blacksmith Ivni:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Enchanting</font> gives weapons or accessories forcefully. At first glance, there's nothing complicated. But then need the master's hand.<br>
You have heard that the Black Anvil smelted <font color="LEVEL">Life Stone</font>? In its properties it resembles the Soul Crystal. If you pull this stone, I'm ready to enchant your armor and weapons.<br>
Just remember that Life Stone forever linked with his own: an enchanted weapon they can neither sell nor exchanged. In addition, any weapon or accessory opportunities which exceed the ability to host, can not be enchanted.<br>
Yes, and you can only enchant items of high quality! So what? Want something to enchant?<br>
