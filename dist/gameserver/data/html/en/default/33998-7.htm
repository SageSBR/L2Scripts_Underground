Blacksmith Ivni:<br>
Do you want to remove Life Stone? Well, it's your charm ... Actually improves things, but once you insist...<br>
Just do not think that extract stone from the weapon so easy! Here we need special equipment and the master's hand. You're in luck: I've done it a thousand times, but I warn you, my services are not cheap.<br>
So what? Would that I learned Life Stone of your gun?<br>
