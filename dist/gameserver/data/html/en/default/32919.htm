Cocoon:<br><br>
Through the thin membrane can be seen as mutates Fairy.<br>
It seems that the cocoon can be broken by hitting it.<br>
And, you can pour in <font color="LEVEL">Mica</font> and thus boost the mutation.<br>
<br>
(To use <font color="LEVEL">Mica</font>, select Cocoon and click on the Mica. If you want to break the Cocoon, hit it, hold down &quot;Ctrl&quot;. 
To improve the efficiency of impact use attacking skills.)<br>
