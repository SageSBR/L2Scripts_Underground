Gracian Survivor:<br>
In the West of the continent of Aden, on the coast of Gludio is the place where flying ships in Gracia. This is a port built by the joint efforts of engineers Aden and masters Gracia.<br>
Due to the fact that the port hangs in the air, on foot can't reach him. You can only teleport there. Among all the Guardians of the Portal there can only send the Keeper of the Portal Gludio and Keeper of the Portal Talking Island.<br>
If you want I can send You in the Air Harbour Gludio. I'll send You to the place where you will teleport to the Portal Keeper Talking Island. I got such rights. While You need to pay a fee. Disgusting, of course...<br>
But you can take it as a donation to the salvation Gracia. If You are a burden, You can get there using the Portal Keepers Talking Island and the Village of Castle Gludio. Think carefully.<br>
