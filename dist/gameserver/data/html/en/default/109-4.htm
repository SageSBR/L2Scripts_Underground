Jack Sage:<br>
All you need to do is work harder on the things that you have done up to now. <font color="LEVEL">Train more, become stronger</font>, and stretch your limits! Soon a great danger will threaten the world. We are in dire need of talented adventurers who are prepared to fight! I recommend you take the Gift of Vitality and go hunting!<br>
