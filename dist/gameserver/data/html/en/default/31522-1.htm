Mysterious Wizard:<br>
Forest of the Dead... It is an abode of souls that are not able to break the link with life. I met the dead who died a ridiculous death or the victim of political intrigue. Yes, the Dark Mages like me here is where to turn. Resentment, anger, death, rage... All the ingredients for a dark magic in one place.<br>
By the way, perhaps your eyes caught my Puppets. They are very dangerous. Avoid them whenever possible.<br>
