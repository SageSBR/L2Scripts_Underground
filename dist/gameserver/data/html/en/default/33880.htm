<html><body>Monk of Chaos:<br>
In the name of balance of power each race was given its own unique skills. However, this balance was broken, after the Will of Chaos was possible to transfer the ability of one race to another representative.<br>
The will of the Chaos that unfolded by our Lord, can give the knowledge and skills that were previously inaccessible to You. Blessed with its greatness can change the balance of power in this world.<br>
If you have the Will of Chaos, You have to fulfill his prophecy. Do this until it is too late.<br>
