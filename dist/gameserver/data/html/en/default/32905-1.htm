Feline tribe to which I belong, called Nya. We are the first who made contact with the Elves! We learned a lot from them, 
and in return gave his own knowledge.<br>
We tried to live in a peaceful neighborhood with other races. Nya is the most advanced of the feline tribes. And we have the highest magical sapconnect! 
And we are much prettier than the tribe Ung! It's so cute, isn't it?<br>
