Welcome! I've been waiting for someone to come here. I have to tell you about a strong magical field in the Tower of Infinitum. If someone who is not of demons will enter the tower of magic protection is activated and will tear apart anyone, but there's a way to get around this, you need to pretend to be a demon.<br>
To do this you must kill the devil and to cover his body with his blood...<br>
