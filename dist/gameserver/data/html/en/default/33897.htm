Theorn:<br>
Hello... My name is Theorn. I study the Power of the Hero. This affair requires a lot <font color="LEVEL">of skill points</font>... And You don't want to sacrifice <font color="LEVEL">skill points</font>? If all goes well, You <font color="LEVEL">will get extra skill points! </font> Ho Ho Ho... don't believe? Then listen!<br>
For the study must <font color="LEVEL">100 Aden 000</font> and <font color="LEVEL">500 000 SP</font>. Prepare all this in advance. <font color="LEVEL">If the research is successful, You will receive twice the number of skill points</font>. But You should know that <font color="LEVEL">if the research fails, all skill points donated will go to pot! </font> And paid adena also not returned.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">And remember that during the study helper magic can disappear in the event of the death of the character. If this happens, You will not get rewards!</font><br>
And by the way, I'm only at night. During the day I disappear, so the award should get to before I disappear. Remember this!<br>
Well? Want to try? Now the last stage of the study. As the final stage of skill points you can add to the Vessel of Darkness or Light Vessel... Well, maybe I will choose?<br>
