<br> In the battle can participate up to 18 characters. If the battle will be declared only one character, it automatically becomes the winner. This is a great success. 
<br> Whatever it was, the battle continues until the last man standing on his feet fighter. Match time - 6 minutes. We will try to plan things so that contestants did not know each other. If by the end of the battle the winner is not determined, the victory goes to the one who laid the most opponents. Every man for himself!
