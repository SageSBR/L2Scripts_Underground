I lost the earthworm in the 100m race! How could this happen?<br>
<Button ALIGN="LEFT" ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 1">&quot;Talking Rabbit competes in the women with an earth worm?!&quot;</button>
<Button ALIGN="LEFT" ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 2">&quot;Perhaps the fact that the length of the worm is 1 000 meters?&quot;</button>
<Button ALIGN="LEFT" ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 3">&quot;Perhaps the worm will be Accelerated?&quot;</button>
<Button ALIGN="LEFT" ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 4">&quot;Probably the reason is that the competition comes at a time of Your NAP?&quot;</button>
