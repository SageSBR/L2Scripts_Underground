[R Grade set option]
</center><br>
Our blacksmith guild endows R-grade armor with a set option or changes the existing set option of R-grade armor at a low price on behalf of you.<br>
You can endow R-grade armor with a set effect.<br>
When wearing multiple pieces of armor with the same set effect, you may receive various abilities.<br>
If you don't like the option which has been already endowed, we will change it at any time.<br>
Please trust in our blacksmiths. They will serve you with all their hearts.<br>
