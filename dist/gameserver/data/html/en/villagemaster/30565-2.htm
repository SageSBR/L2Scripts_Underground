<html><body>Lord Flame Kakai:<br>
Initially we, Orcs, consisted of seven strong tribes and ruled the whole world. But about 2 000 years ago we got involved in a large-scale war against those despicable Elves. Of course, the superiority of our race over any other was undeniable, which is why the Elves have teamed up with these evil and cunning people. Their combined army defeated us and we were forced to leave their lands. But these arrogant Elves were betrayed by the people and were banished to the forest. "The hand that strikes the blow, also can hit," as they say.<br>
After the war, our people have built a new house here on <font color="LEVEL">the Plateau of Immortality</font>, which was once sacred land of Paagrio, and we are gradually preparing to bring back our former glory. But <font color="LEVEL">Ragna Tribe</font>, one of the seven tribes who had betrayed the others. Their shameful act left a stain on the honor of our people. This is unforgivable! They don't even have the right to be called Orcs.<br>
