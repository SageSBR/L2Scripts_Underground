 Grand Master Alden:<br>
Welcome to the Embassy of the human race. I am a great master ambassador Alden.<br>
At the summit in Giran, it was agreed that each race has sent a representative here to facilitate cooperation in the fight against the forces of evil. It's hard to say this, however, we humans are often distracted by internal squabbles over territory, religion or government. To establish an alliance with other races for us can be very difficult.<br>
Especially if some of the nerds, such as the High Priest of Einhasad behave as if they are the ambassadors. While all are well aware that they only have to represent the interests of the temples and only ... Yes ... I'm sorry, excuse me, I'm just tired, complaints are now useless.<br>
How can I help you?<br>
