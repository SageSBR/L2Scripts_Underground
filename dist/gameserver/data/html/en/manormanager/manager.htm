<html><head>I am a trader sent by the Lord to sell the manor's seeds and purchase indigenous products.<br>
The seeds that I'm selling can be sowed only in this manor. However, the indigenous products can be sold to any castle. For a small commission, I'll sell them on behalf of you to other manors in other castles.<br>
The sale and purchasing of seed starts from 8 p.m. everyday. Look up information of the manor posted from 6 a.m., get prepared ahead, and come back at 8 p.m.  Hurry up before the goods are sold out, ha, ha.<br>
If you have any such indigenous products, I will buy them from you now. The Lord will be pleased.<br>
Don't be embarrassed if you don't know the meanings of some of the words I use, such as "manor" or "indigenous product". All questions will be answered, you need only ask. <br>
