Guard Zerome:<br>
Not long ago, I made the rounds of <font color="LEVEL">Death Pass.</font> There, I saw flying harpies and medusas. I don t think a commoner could come back alive. They look like beautiful women, but they are actually ferocious beasts. If you meet them there, you must be careful. If you are tricked by their appearance, your life may be in danger.<br>
