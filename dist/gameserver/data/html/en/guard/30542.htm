Defender Runant:<br>
Hey, I see you often these days. Me? Can't you see? I am Defender Runant, who protects the village. Ouch... My dang back is sore because I am standing all day. Maybe I should consider retirement? Ah, but I want to be as famous as <font color="LEVEL">Hero Lucien</font> and live in peace...<br>
