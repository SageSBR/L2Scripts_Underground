Captain Lucas:<br>
Come closer young friend. I salute you, welcome to <font color="LEVEL">Dion</font>. I'm Lucas, the eldest among the local guards. You first of Dion? I don't know what brings you here, but keep in mind that the village is quiet and peaceful. Will be asked to refrain from negative actions and during your stay here to be cool.<br>
By the way, is only protected area of the village, outside is very dangerous. If possible, try to travel in a group. Good luck to you!<br>
