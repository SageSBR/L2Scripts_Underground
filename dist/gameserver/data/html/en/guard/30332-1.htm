Captain Bathis:<br>
It is the residence of Lord Gludio. 
Originally, these were the ruins left by the giants, but the wise king brought me there ordered to build there for protection from Gracia castle. 
A few years ago when Gracia recent times attacked our Kingdom was formed by a detachment of defenders of Gludio. 
This castle was the stronghold and our stronghold in the fight against the invaders. 
We are grateful to the Lord for his wise foresight, who played a huge role in the victory.<br>
