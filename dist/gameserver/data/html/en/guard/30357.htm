Sentry Krispen:<br>
I am Sentry Krispen. What do you know? You can rest safely in this part near the village because we are protecting it. You don't have to worry, since our bravery cannot be compared to the cowardly Elves. I just wish there was some way to get rid of all the <font color="LEVEL">imps</font> that wander around in our forest.<br>
