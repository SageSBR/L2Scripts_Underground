Captain Bathis:<br>
Greetings, young traveler. I, Captain Bathis, lead the guards responsible for the security and peace of mind in this village and the surrounding area. 
You see <font color="LEVEL">the Castle of Gludio</font> behind the bridge? 
When I look at this magnificent castle, the residence of my Lord, I am overwhelmed with pride and reverence.<br>
I'm sorry, but I can give You some advice? 
You only see what You wear? 
Fashion is very good, but I don't think armor should be worn for style
Even if it doesn't sound flattering, You really need something more reliable! Yes, Yes, Yes... Young man!<br>
