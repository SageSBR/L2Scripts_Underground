Captain Moun:<br>
Welcome to Oren, the young traveller. I Moun, working for our Lord, guard the city.<br>
As Oren is located close to a competitor of the Aden Kingdom - the Kingdom of Elmore, Oren guards constantly on the alert. 
It can deliver travellers like You're in trouble, but You must understand us correctly.<br>
In fact, people here are the same as in Elmore. It doesn't matter whether we use wood in their own needs or not. 
I can even name ten of the Elmore immediately, ha ha!<br>
See the castle on the North hill? This Oren castle. Kazdy time looking at it, I pray that the people in it never knew grief, and to residents of Elmore was aware of its power.<br>
