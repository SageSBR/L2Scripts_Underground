Captain Mathias:<br>
People should not spread false rumors! I've heard them before... the devil worshippers, vampires, and the like... the Ravings of a drunkard! This city is well protected by our Royal guards! Don't worry! Who is spreading this lie? If You hear anyone talking such rubbish, let me know immediately! I know You're not stupid enough to listen to this! The rich people in this town have a very vague idea about such unfounded the alarmists! In your place, I would listen to my words!<br>
