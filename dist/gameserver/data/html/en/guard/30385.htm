Be careful! This place is very crowded because of construction on the village wall. Wooden props may collapse or bricks may fall, so be on alert.<br>
Many are experiencing discomfort due to the construction. In particular, the Traders from <font color="LEVEL">Giran</font> have many complaints. I hope the construction is finished quickly so that the travelers can enter the village through a proper gate.<br>
