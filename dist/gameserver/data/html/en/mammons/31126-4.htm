Blacksmith of Mammon:<br>
I'll exchange the weapon that you've been using for a weapon that is one level stronger. Pay me the difference in Ancient Adena.<br>
There's something you should know. <font color="LEVEL">Special abilities</font> don't transfer. And if you transfer <font color="LEVEL">enchantments</font>, the new weapon will not be enchanted.<br>
