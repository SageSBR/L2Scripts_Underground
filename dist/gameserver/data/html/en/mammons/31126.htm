Blacksmith of Mammon:<br>
May Mammon bless you! I, the Blacksmith of Mammon, have come to offer you arms of the highest quality.<br>
I shall mend your weapons and armor with skills that no novice blacksmith could ever hope to imitate.<br>
Yet there are a few things I must tell you. Although we dwarves of Mammon didn't deal in coins of the outside world before, we have changed with the times and now accept them. Also remember that you can only remove seals from A-grade items with village blacksmiths now. Lastly, I can change the status of Bound items for you, if you provide an Unbinding Scroll for me.<br>
