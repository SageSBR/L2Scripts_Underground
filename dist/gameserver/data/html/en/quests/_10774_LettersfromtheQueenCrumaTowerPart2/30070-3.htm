I think You will find it near the Mage Jansen.<br>So, go to the <font color="LEVEL">3rd floor of the Tower the Marshlands</font>, to talk with <font color="LEVEL">the Magician of the Ivory Tower Roblem</font>. Hopefully, it will tell You where to find Giants.<br>I will pray that this time You got the answers to your questions. Yes You can light Einhasad.</body></html>
