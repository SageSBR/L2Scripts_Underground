<html><body>Lady of the Lake: <br>
Once you have shared with me water, which was probably
not easy to get, I'll help you. But I can not send you straight to Nerupe ...
I'll send you to Anghel Waterfall, which leads to Magmeld.
Going into the cave under Angelic Falls, you will find a Gatekeeper Rukh. <br>
Ask her to send you a hug .. <br> Timiniel
