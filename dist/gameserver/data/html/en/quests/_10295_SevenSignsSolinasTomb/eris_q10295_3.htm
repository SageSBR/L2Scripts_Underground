Sister of Silence Eris:<br>
Everyone who enters the room Solina, except the creators of the sign engine - Eris Kaeruna and Anais are considered invaders. But I'm just a spirit that can not leave this room, so I can not help chtonichem. You just have to destroy the print. To do this you will have to combat the four Guardians of Treasures.<br>
