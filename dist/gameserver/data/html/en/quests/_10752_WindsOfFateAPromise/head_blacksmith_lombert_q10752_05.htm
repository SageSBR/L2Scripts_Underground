I don't know. Who wants to go in these dead lands? But if You need to, go into the Forest of the Dead, which was formerly the land of the family Von Hellman. They say that since the advent of the Forest of the Dead there is always one MAG. He might know where in <font color="LEVEL">the Forest of the Dead</font> to find family members Background Hellman.<br>
No one knows what he's doing or where she came from, why we call it <font color="LEVEL">Mysterious Magician</font>.
