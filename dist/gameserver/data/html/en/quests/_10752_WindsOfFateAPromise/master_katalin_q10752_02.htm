Master Katrina:<br>
This is <font color="LEVEL">the Device for Predictions</font>, which was used by <font color="LEVEL">the ancient Artie</font>. It helps to keep the predictions in the original form and transmit to their descendants. Thanks to this device we are seeing what is being said in the ancient legends. Thank Benira, the great soothsayer, pales before this strange device!<br>
Despite the fact that we have in hand is just a part of the Device, we can check its contents.<br>
