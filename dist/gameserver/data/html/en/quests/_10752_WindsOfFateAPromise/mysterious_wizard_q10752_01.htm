Mysterious Mage:<br>
Do you want to bequeath me your body? Suddenly You will die during his travels... Ah! Yes do not worry! Judge for yourself - much nicer after death to get to the lab, than lying in a roadside ditch.<br>
By the way... You are not interested in dark magic? I'm sure You will get a perfect dark mage. You are my most capable student.<br>
