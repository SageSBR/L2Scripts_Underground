Chief Smith Lambert:<br>
You Area? You come from the world of Spirits of the Wind. Say, near Benon there is a small forest. There lives my friend Dulkin. He wears the armor of leaves all day and chews tobacco. He always admired the beauty of Benon. He said that it was much better there than in this dark place. I don't know whether he's right or not. I'm good here.<br>
What happened? You came for the guns?<br>
