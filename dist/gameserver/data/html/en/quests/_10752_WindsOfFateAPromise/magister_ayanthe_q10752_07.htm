Master ARIS:<br>
Hard time You had? Well You know... All the same Rune is very different from local places. But I had no doubt that You will cope with the task.<br>
I heard that You talked to Callie, Sareban about Cayn. Your voice was much louder!<br>
Now You can get the second Release. I will help You learn how to better manage this power. Now choose what You like...<br>
