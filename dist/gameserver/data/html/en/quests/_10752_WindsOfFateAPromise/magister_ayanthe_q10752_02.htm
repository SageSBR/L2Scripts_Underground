Master ARIS:<br>
This is <font color="LEVEL">the Device for Predictions</font>, which was used by <font color="LEVEL">the ancient Artie</font>. It helps to keep the predictions in the original form and transmit to their descendants. The first time I see this device. Even Terenius, the oldest among us, never saw him. Venir De Gan began the restoration of this device, trying to understand the ancient technology Arta.<br>
And in the end he still managed! We were able to learn some content.<br>
