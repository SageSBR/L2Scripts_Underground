Master Katrina:<br>
I know you talked about Cayn with Callie, Sareban. I followed You and all overheard. I had so much fun! Maybe I should stop teaching beginners and to go scouting? Oh, I'm just kidding. Kidding! Calm down, please.<br>
Now You can get the second Release. I will help You to direct your force in the right direction. Now, choose what You like...<br>
