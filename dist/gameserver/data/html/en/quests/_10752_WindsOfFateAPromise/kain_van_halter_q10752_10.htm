Ha-ha-ha! So I called in the predictions of Arta. My mother is originally not from the Royal family. She belonged to the aristocracy. She's just an ordinary woman, which was sweet to the king - my father. Why I don't like his name. Yes, I'm a Prince... But it's just sounding title. From him any good. However, I saved it, benon. So is that why my, <font color="LEVEL">Kaina</font>, styled <font color="LEVEL">noble hero</font>?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The sacred Cup</font>... This is the same as that of <font color="LEVEL">the Holy Grail</font>? The pieces I have stored. They will help to see the remaining part of the prophecy.<br>
Take. You can take them.<br>
Well?.. Hmm...<br>
