Callie, Saraban:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">A great warrior from people People</font>. They say he came out <font color="LEVEL">of Elmore</font>. He fights <font color="LEVEL">with two swords</font>... And also searching for <font color="LEVEL">the Holy Grail</font>. Cayn had declined the award and, without lingering in the village, went further.<br>
I don't know who he is and why he came to us for help. But I think that Caine is the thread that can lead us to the Holy Grail.<br>
We have to find him.<br>
