Great Master Sigmund:<br>
Cayn? You mean Gran Kaina? Haha! Haha...<br>
But how do You know that name? I think You're talking about someone called <font color="LEVEL">the Kain van Halter</font>. This <font color="LEVEL">Prince of Elmore</font>. He is a Gladiator and an excellent fighter. I'd like to fight him.<br>
But You have appeared recently. How did You know about Kain van Halter?<br>
