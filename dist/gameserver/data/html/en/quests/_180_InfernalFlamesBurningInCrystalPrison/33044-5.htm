 Fioren:<br>
I ask You to liquidate the Keeper of Baylor's in 
the depth of the Crystal Maze, and then bring 
me signs. We can release Parnassus from the influence of demons 
only if we will hold on these signs cleaning 
ritual. You know, demon Baylor's is not a weak opponent, 
so bring on the battle with him as much as possible colleagues.
