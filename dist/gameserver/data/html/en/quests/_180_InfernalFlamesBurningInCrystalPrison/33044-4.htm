 Fioren:<br>
Now the Crystal Maze is in the hands caused by Belafon 
demons and Baylor's, which manages them. I think they are trying 
to get force Water through Gem Panarion, 
located in the depths of the Crystal Maze. And demons, and 
minions Shillien pose a great threat to us, but 
if they can awaken Fan√°rion... Oh, with this disaster, I think 
we would not cope. Need as soon as possible to stop Baylor's and his demons. <br>
Please, help me.<br>
