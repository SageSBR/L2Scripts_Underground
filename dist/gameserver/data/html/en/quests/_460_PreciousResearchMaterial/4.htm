Alright then, straight to the point.<br>
If You go straight through mine, we will soon see <font color="LEVEL">the Eggs</font> of Trajan. These break down to get the <font color="LEVEL">Parts of eggs of Trajan</font>. 'll give you a hint: breaking <font color="LEVEL">eggs with a blue sheen</font>, You are more likely to get <font color="LEVEL">Parts of eggs of Trajan</font>, than if they would break the other eggs. It will be enough to collect <font color="LEVEL">20</font> Pieces of eggs of Trajan.<br>
Take them to my principal <font color="LEVEL">to Filara</font> in the village <font color="LEVEL">of Suchart</font>. You'll give him what I had to give in life.<br>
Good luck! Now go.
