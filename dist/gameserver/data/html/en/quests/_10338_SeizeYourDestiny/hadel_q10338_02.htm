My lord <font color="LEVEL"> Germunkus </font> - the last of the Giants. Once upon a time, during the War of the Gods and the Giants, my lord fought on equal terms with the gods. And seized power. But in the end the Giants destroyed, and my master was the last of its kind.<br>
No matter how strong the gods, they could not kill such a great warrior. They tore it into pieces and hid them in different corners of the continent, and the Spirit of the Lord was imprisoned at the Flying Island.<br>
When Flying Island fell from the shock split seal, and the spirit of my lord awoke. If you help to remove the remaining print, it will be free!<br>
