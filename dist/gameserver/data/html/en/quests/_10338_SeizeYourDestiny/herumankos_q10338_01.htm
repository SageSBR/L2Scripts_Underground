When I received your help, I did not care who you are. Thank you! Thanks to you, I was released from the prison of the spirit.<br>
I am the last of the Giants. <font color="LEVEL"> Germunkus </font>. In ancient times, we have had dominion over all races. To adequately thank you, I give you <font color="LEVEL"> Records Hell </font>, stored by generations of Giants. They hid all the power of the ancient Giants.<br>
However, a brave warrior ... For the sake of this power you may have to give up everything than you had before. If there is no other option, use this. I think you can handle ... What did you decide? Entries take Hell?<br>
