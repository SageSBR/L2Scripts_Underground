Callie, Saraban:<br>
I heard on <font color="LEVEL">the Talking Island</font> there is a master that can teach You how to use this power. Trust in it. The wise teacher always sees the future of his students.<br>
With its help, the wizards become powerful warriors, and thieves become skilled healers.<br>
What's her name?.. <font color="LEVEL">Rean</font>?.. Yes, I remember! Her name is Rean.<br>
(Speaking on the island You can find <font color="LEVEL">the Wizard, the Subclass/Dual Class Rean</font>.)
