Master The Subclass/Dual Class Rean:<br>
Well. Calm down, I haven't accused You of anything. Well take a deep breath - You are just too excited about what happened. My job is not to scare You but the consequences to guide the right path. So, now inside You lurks not only the power Arta, but the strength of Giants. It will not be easy to live with... You must be very careful not to lose control of it.<br>
