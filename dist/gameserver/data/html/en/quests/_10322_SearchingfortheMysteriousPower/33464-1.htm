<html><body>From the Evian:<br>
You got the weapon. And have You ever had to use it?<br>
Ever have to put the weapons in the course even in such mirkou and safe village like ours. Try to use the weapons that You have.<br>
Take a weapon and use it on <font color="LEVEL">the Scarecrow</font>. Stuffed animals are not able to attack You, so you can be calm. Beat them until there is no longer.
