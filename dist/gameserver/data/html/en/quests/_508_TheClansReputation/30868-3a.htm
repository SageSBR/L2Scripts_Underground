Sir Eric Rodemai:<br>
Too bad! I need you to slaughter* Gargoyle Lord Tiphon *and bring me his Shard!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">As I told you before, you dont't have to kill her yourself!</font> There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Palibati Queen Themis and then bring his Shard to me.<br>
