Giant's Minion Janitt:<br>It's kind of a saga, so listen carefully! An ancient Giant called <font color="LEVEL">Argos once made <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad</font> angry, and was exiled to the <font color="LEVEL">Wall of Argos</font> for punishment. He's been there ever since. Now, we have <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> trying to get him on their side. Just imagine it! An ancient giant with incredible power, working for Embryo? What do you think will come of that?<br></font><br>
