To get to the <font color="LEVEL">Harnak Underground Ruins</font>, you have to meet <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Minion Hadel</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Exploration Zone 1 of the Ruins of Ye Sagira</font>. Do you remember the person who sent you to the place where you received your new power? Hadel will explain what to do.<br>You aren't planning to walk to the Ruins of Ye Sagira, right?<br>Use the <font color="LEVEL">Lamoon</font> <font color="LEVEL">next to Gatekeeper Milia</font>. How do you use it? You'll find out when you get there.</body></html>
