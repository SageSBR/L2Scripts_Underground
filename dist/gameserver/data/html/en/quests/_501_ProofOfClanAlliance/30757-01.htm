Statue of Offering:<br>
Do you wish to take the test for the clan lord you are serving? I warn you. The moment you give your answer, you may lose your life.<br>
Only the person who has made a firm resolution should come forward and answer my question.<br>
Is your clan lord worthy of you risking your life? Is your loyalty more important than your own life?  Now, give me an answer!<br>
