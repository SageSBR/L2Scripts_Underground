Legs Germunkusa also broke into small pieces. <br>
But luckily, I found a wizard who can bring back the arms and legs Germunkusa to its original state. <br>
It <font color="LEVEL"> Master Ishuma </ font>. He just restore fossilized limbs Germunkusa. Will be as good as new. <br>
Heir Force Giant. We must hurry. Take the fossilized arms and legs of Germunkusa to <font color="LEVEL"> Master Ishuma </ font>. Of course, I am ready to pay him for the job. The main thing is that he restored the body of the Lord.
