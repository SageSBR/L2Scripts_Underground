 Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:<br>
Let's take a breath. Was indeed bitter 
battle. Behind these gates should be located 
the ringleader. We must hurry to destroy the bastard and 
to put an end to a grueling battle.<br>
I grumbled a bit at You, but know what You 
capable of and will help You to Express your potential.
Lend me one thing for a while.<br>
