 Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:<br>
This ring I got from Orvana. He commanded me 
lend it to someone I deem enough 
able for the upcoming battles.<br>
This is a beautiful ring that awakens hidden 
the ability of the owner. Once You put on it, and 
You will be able to use part of the huge 
forces that You have to get
subsequently. <br>
So if You're ready, try fully 
to end the constant influx of evil spirits.
