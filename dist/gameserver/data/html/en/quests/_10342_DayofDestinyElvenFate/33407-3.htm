 Quartermaster:<br>
Here they are, relics of fighters... Thank you! The people and heirs of soldiers will not forget Your work. 
All the dead heroes deserve to be remembered.<br>
Looks like I now have nothing more to ask You.
I'm very worried about Adolf and his soldiers invaded the base monsters. Probably The Chief 
Vanguard also needs podderzjivaiu force in these fierce battles.
You should visit Adolf and offer him help.<br>
