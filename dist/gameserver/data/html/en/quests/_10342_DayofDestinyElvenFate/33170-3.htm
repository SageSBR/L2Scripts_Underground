 Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:<br>
Looks like You made a choice. If you are ready, go to 
the enemy's camp. That You have 
to do, nothing complicated. Will need to just
destroy all the enemies that will come across 
on the eyes.
The fight will be fierce. If I fall, You will need
to flee this place. I can't 
so You died with me. As for me - 
don't exist. I guess
who will take over my post...
Are you ready?<br>
