The Monarch of Flame Kekei:<br>
<br>
Lieven Waldner of Lands Giran - my old
friend. I myself can not come to the rescue ... but
I can entrust this task to you.
<br>
Right now, with the help of <font color="LEVEL"> Gatekeeper </font>
<font color="LEVEL"> Millia </font>, which you can find at the end of the left
Tonel Museum, move to <font color="LEVEL"> center </font> Gludio.
Show this letter of recommendation
<font color="LEVEL"> Chief of Guards </font> Batis, and he will tell you about the
Sakuma.
<br>
Pa'agrian flame be with you!
