 The Messenger of God Tipiya:<br>
For this we need to destroy their leader. Destroy-Bound Ancients and Heroes
run into a leader. In the group of 10 monsters. What kind of monster will last
impossible to know in advance. But whoever it was, kill them all.
This task must be repeated 2 times, then it will be possible to change the location.
Of course, you can count on a corresponding reward.<br>
Time to decide. Do you accept this fate?<br>
