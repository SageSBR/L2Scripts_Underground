 Divine Messenger Lydia:<br>
Don't You ever see? All residents of Magolda believe that the Orbis Temple is the abode of heroes, 
that everyone is happy under the hero Octavia. And what we believe in ordinary people usually is not the truth. 
But smoke without fire, of course, does not happen.<br>
What truth would You like to know? The truth you believe in wimps? Or real, at the heart of what's going on?<br>
