 Divine Messenger Lydia:<br>
Then it is better that You experience it for yourself. It's hard to tell from the words of others. 
Such truth dispelled the mist from the slightest doubt.<br>
The only way to find out may be the destruction <font color="LEVEL">of the Damned Ancient Heroes</font>. 
They were once a mighty and fair, the gods themselves lovingly treated them, and 
now this greatness is almost nothing left... Here are their full names: 
<font color="LEVEL">Damn Victim Orbis, Cursed Guardian Of The Aurbis, Cursed Thrower Orbis, Damn Scientist Orbis, Cursed By An Ancient Hero Of The Aurbis, Damn Senior Scientist Of The Aurbis</font>.<br>
Having battled with them, You will come to know the essence of <font color="LEVEL">the Corruptive Darkness</font>.<br>
