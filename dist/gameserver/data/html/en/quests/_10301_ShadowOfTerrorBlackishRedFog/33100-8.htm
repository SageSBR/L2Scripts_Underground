 Magmeld Emissary Leader Lada:<br>
Nice of You agreed! Then now go to the entrance to the cave 
for <font color="LEVEL">Angel Falls</font> and 
find <font color="LEVEL">the Green giant, who love Bog Spirits</font>. 
Try to use this <font color="LEVEL">Shimmering Crystal</font>. They 
made of Mica mined in Marmalde. So, in Aden, you cannot get anything like this.<br>
If You use Sparkling Crystals will start around 
to gather <font color="LEVEL">Swamp Spirits</font>.<br>
Catch Swamp Ghost and take it Slake to the Ancient City of Arcan. 
Then the elder will be favorable to You.<br>
Cats are very suspicious, so You did not manage to find out, if you come with empty hands.<br>
