High Priest Raymond:<br>
My friend! I was waiting for You! <br1>In the vicinity of Gludio appeared items, which, apparently, come from <font color="LEVEL">the spirit world Wind</font>.<br>
I wanted to ask for help in the delegation of Artie, but it turned out that they do not stay in one place for a long time.<br>
One of them went to the place where they found these items, but never returned.<br>
