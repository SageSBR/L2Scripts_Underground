Master Katrina:<br>
Recently we were approached by the priests of the Temple Einhasad, which is located in Gludio. Near the city they found the subject from the world of Spirits of the Wind. But the Delegation was not able to stay long in Gludio, so on his quest sent <font color="LEVEL">Teresia</font>. Maybe she had already started the job.<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">the Temple Einhasad</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>. <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Raymond</font> will tell You where to find Teresia.
