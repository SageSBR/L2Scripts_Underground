Master Katrina:<br>
Queen Serenia often asks about You. I talked to her a few days ago... She told me that it will come to me of Area that wants to develop their full potential. I think she has great hopes. Although the Queen herself only half of Area, she has powerful magical abilities. I think she knew about You prior to Your appearance.<br>
