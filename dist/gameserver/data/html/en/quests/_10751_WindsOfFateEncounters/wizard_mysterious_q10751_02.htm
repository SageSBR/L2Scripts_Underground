Mysterious Mage:<br>
I? Maybe You mean another mage? In the end, in light of the many wizards.<br>
Listen... I have studied the body of the deceased Artei. Don't get angry. I did nothing wrong and have nothing to do with her death.<br>
I can prove the sincerity of his intentions. Here, take. This is <font color="LEVEL">a subject that I found</font> on the body of the poor girl. Looks like he's from another world, right?<br>
Take it as a sign of my location. I hope that we will meet again...
