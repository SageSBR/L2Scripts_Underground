High Priest Raymond:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Mysterious Mage</font>? Hmm... I Remember that the guards talked about it. This is the same mage who passed by? Hmm... he's Hardly involved in this case. He spoke about the objects from the spirit world Wind. Besides, he had not received any benefits from her death.<br>
Anyway, not to lose time in vain! Faster return to <font color="LEVEL">benon</font> to <font color="LEVEL">Master ARIS</font> and tell us about what happened to the girl from the Delegation!
