High Priest Raymond:<br>
The guards said that this mage was just passing by. But the girl from the Delegation that was here recently, said that if he was able to learn the subject from the world of Spirits of the Wind, it is not an ordinary mage.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">northeast</font>. The girl from the Delegation went there in search <font color="LEVEL">of Skeleton Warriors</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Archers</font>. These Skeletons have the same subjects from the world of the Spirits of the Wind, like the one I showed You.<br>
Be careful. Let the force be with You light!
