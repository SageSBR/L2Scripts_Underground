The Persecutor Hatov:<br><br>
We were inattentive. We thought that once <font color="LEVEL">a Bum</font> one, then we can easily catch him. However, in <font color="LEVEL">the Dead Forest</font> he met reinforcements. We were not prepared for such resistance, and survived just me. Fortunately, I was able to improve health through <font color="LEVEL">the Golden Mercenary</font>, but this is not enough. Therefore, go for a Tramp instead of me.<br><br>
