<br>Hmm... It disputes Shriker. A little different from the usual bickering, but I recognize them.
<br>It seems that Trickery mutated, trying to adapt to new conditions. That's a new look.
<br>Please, do not be alarmed. It's all the same Trickery, only a little more color and a bit stronger. But why have You brought me these disputes?
