<html><head><body>Forest Patrol Leira:
<br>Trickery are Spirits of Mushrooms. Usually it is lovely and quiet spirits, but in the material world they have become dangerous. When they were in the world of Spirits of the Wind, nobody was afraid.<br>
Oh... something I digress. I was told about <font color="LEVEL">a strange Ghost Mushrooms</font>.<br>All Trickery that live here, one color. 
But recently, when I went to find Ricky, I saw Sikera, which was a different color.<br>Maybe Striker - poisonous spirit... Then my Ricky is in danger! 
Please find out the truth whether it is poisonous!
