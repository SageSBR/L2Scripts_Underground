 Horpina:<br>
I don't know, maybe You happened to be in the Central Flower bed, located in the bottom of the garden? 
There is the prison where imprisoned creature called the Kraken Afros. 
It is guarded by a militant Keepers. In the past they were honest and valiant warriors, 
enjoyed the special protection of the gods, now... I don't know what might happen 
with our Magolda due to the machinations that they weave.<br>
So I want to address You with a request...<br>
