 Horpina:<br>
In ancient times, the gods instructed the Defenders to protect the Forerunners. 
Now, when the old gods are gone, the Defenders, attracted by the lust for power, 
intend to use the power of the Forerunners for their own purposes. I heard a rumor that 
some of the Precursors appeared in the Ancient City of Arcan and Lands in Aden, where they wreak havoc and destruction. 
Who knows what else will happen if you do not stop Defenders.<br>
Our people are trying to stop their evil plans. But we need help. Please assist - 
destroy 30 Defenders.<br>
