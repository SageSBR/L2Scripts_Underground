Priestess Pivka:<br>
We serve Einhasad, goddess of light, order and power.<br>
Many centuries ago Einhasad captivated Shillien, the evil goddess of death. It also destroyed the Giants mired in their arrogance and corruption and sought to overthrow the gods.<br>
The people of this world have long served as Einhasad faithfully.<br>
Recently, however, we see signs of the return of Shillien - its influence increases, groups of her followers, hordes of monsters invaded our peaceful land.<br>
In our age of warring generals and ambitious adventurers all this plays into the hands of only evil.<br>
Our goal is by all means to maintain order and to do the will of Einhasad.<br>
