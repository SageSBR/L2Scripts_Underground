Giant's Minion Jokel:<br><br>
Varangka is unrivaled in his dark curses. He has set up a force field around himself to stop us from attacking him. Before we can do anything, we have to find a way to destroy the force field.<br>
I've found an old enemy of Varangka's, who might know something of the force field's weaknesses. I want you to talk to him and follow any instructions he give you.<br><br>
