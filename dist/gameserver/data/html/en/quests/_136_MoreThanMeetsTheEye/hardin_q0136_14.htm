Hardin:<br>
Print Transform magically to save the information and energy of the soul that is necessary to maintain the appearance of a living creature...<br>
Unfortunately, I can't link this Print of Transformation with your body. It's just not my specialty...<br>
However, the Magician transformations of the avant-garde will be able to configure the Print Conversion. You will find it in the Ivory Tower.<br>
If you pass it the value of Print, detailed method of preparation and the energy of the magic transformation, he will be able to create for You Print.<br>
