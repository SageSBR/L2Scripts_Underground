Hardin:<br>
(When you drink the potion, you feel a sharp headache.
 You can't gather my thoughts and see the world from two sides, as through a mirror.
 Everything starts to spin. In your soul is changing something important...
 You see Hardeen like at the end of a long tunnel. He casts a spell...
 Time passes, the world stops spinning, You come in.)<br>
Did it! Did it!<br>
You did it, my young Guinea!<br>
Now your soul is able to bear turning.<br>
Excellent!<br>
