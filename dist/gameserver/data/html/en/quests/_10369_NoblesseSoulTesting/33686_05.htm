Good. It says that the energies of the Aden Castle and Rune Castle regions have been corrupted from the frequent battles in those regions. I will give you the Seed of Helping in order to purify those energies. Please return after planting the Seed of Helping in <font color="LEVEL">the regions where greenish for is intense</font> near either <font color="LEVEL">Aden Castle</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Rune Castle</font>. If you plant the Seed of Helping, a tree will grow.<br>
If you plant the Tree of Helping, you can get the <font color="LEVEL">Ashes of Remnants</font> as the surroundings are purified. I want you to bring me those ashes.<br>
I will also give you <font color="LEVEL">a Scroll of Escape that can take you straight to Aden Castle or Rune Castle</font>.
