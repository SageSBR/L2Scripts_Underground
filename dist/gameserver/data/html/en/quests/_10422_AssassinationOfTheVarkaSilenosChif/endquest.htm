<html><head><body>Giant's Minion Hansen:<br>You got rid of <font color="LEVEL">Kampf</font> as well as the chief of the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>-loving <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenoses</font>. What an achievement! I believe our work together is finished. <br>But I'll continue tracking <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>. They will definitely hatch some new plot. <br>Regarding your great achievement this time, I will report to <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> in detail. We, the Giant's Minions, will always remember you. Thank you.</body></html>
