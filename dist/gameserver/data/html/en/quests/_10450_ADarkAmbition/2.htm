Captain Mathias:<br><br>
The Orc Superbia are legendary for their strength among the orcs. Seeing them fighting head-on with the Noble Orcs was really something else. It was like...the day the Blackish Red Fog had appeared.<br>
Ceasefires are dandy, but I'm sure there is something going on under the surface. Flame Lord Kakai agrees with me, and this is why the Flame Patrol is stationed near Gainak. <br>
The patrol has reported that there is something sinister in lands near Gainak. Lord Kakai and the Town of Rune are very wary.<br><br>
