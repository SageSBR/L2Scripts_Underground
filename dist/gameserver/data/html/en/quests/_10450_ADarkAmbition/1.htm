Captain Mathias:<br><br>
Noble Orcs... They are your friends and the orcs in the Town of Rune. <font color="LEVEL">Orc Supervia</font> are a group that stood against the <font color="LEVEL">Noble Orcs</font>.<br>

We, the Kingdom of Elmore, formed an alliance with them to keep the Orc Supervia in check. With the help of Kakai, the Lord of Flame, we finally called a ceasefire.<br>
But... I cannot help but think that the situation is still unstable.<br><br>
