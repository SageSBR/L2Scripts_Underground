What kind of questions? as if this news is for you.
After all, everyone knows that the monster Sakuma,
escaped from the Maze Talking Island,
rob in these places.
<br>
Recently I saw the <font color="LEVEL"> evil </font> ran Sakuma
nearby ... I did not dare to attack him, so
both had one. I suspect that some of the
Sakuma artifacts affected the ants and they
turned into a monster.
<br>
Ah ... So many say that dizzy.
<br>
Now I need some rest.
Well, if you'll have any questions, please check back
later.
