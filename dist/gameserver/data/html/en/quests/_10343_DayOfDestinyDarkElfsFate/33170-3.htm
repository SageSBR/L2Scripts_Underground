It looks like you made a choice. If you are ready, go to the 
the enemy"s camp. The fact that you have to

our eyes.
The battle will be fierce. If I fall, you will need to

so you died with me. As for me - 
essential we do not have. I guess about,
Who will take on my post ...
Well, everybody ready?<br>
