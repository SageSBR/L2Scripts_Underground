You have collected blood samples? Thank you! Nothing special happened during the job?
What? Say they do not fall asleep, the smell of them paralyzed? Hmm, I even think about this but could not.<br>
Well, okay. Anyway, I was right, thinking that the smell of Rose Caves somehow affects animals.
I will send these samples to Aden and ask to conduct research. Thank you!<br>
