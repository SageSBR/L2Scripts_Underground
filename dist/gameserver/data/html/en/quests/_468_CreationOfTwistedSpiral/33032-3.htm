Thank you! First you need to take animals to the Cave of the Roses, so they breathe the flavor.
And then you need to collect 20 samples of animal blood. Of course, if you are someone will stop, destroy him.
The most important thing - it's samples. You can first destroy the animals, and then collect samples. I hope for you.
