Queen Navari:<br>
Can't be... is this Astatin? Even in the spirit world Wind these stones are very rare. Where did You get it? You have found the instrument for predictions, and now Astatin... And did not flinch in the face of danger. It is of such a character say artasia prophecy. But... this Astatin I see for the first time. From the stone of waves of anxiety... Maybe he was affected by the material world? Maybe he is full of magical energy?<br>
Hmm... anyway, I can't accept it. This Astatin designed your destiny...<br>
