Lich King Icarus:<br>
So, I need a red rose. Take this white rose and its color into the color of <font color="LEVEL">the Blood of eve</font>. Why are You pale? I'm not asking to kill anyone.<br>
Don't worry. This ingredient has <font color="LEVEL">Witches Atreia</font>. Follow her request to get the paint. See, the job is not complicated. But pretty boring. Hehe.
