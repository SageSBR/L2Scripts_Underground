High Priest Gereth:<br>
This Astatin! This is a very rare stone that is hard to find even in the world of Spirits of the Wind. It contains inexhaustible magic power. I myself have never seen such stones. Because it is forbidden... Forbidden? And why?<br>
Hmm... anyway, I'm glad I saw Astatin. Rather, show the stone Serenyi.
