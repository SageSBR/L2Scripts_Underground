Magister Ayanthe:<br>
A long time ago on earth, a meteorite fell. Mages began to study it, and then built near the tower, which conducted the study. And then this tower was a place of powerful mages. They use something similar to alchemy, which we came up with after being caught in the Material World. Go there and deliver the Device to the Predictions from the influence of the magic of the material world.<br>
