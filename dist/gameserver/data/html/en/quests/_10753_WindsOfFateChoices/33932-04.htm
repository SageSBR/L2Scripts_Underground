High Priest Gereth:<br>

<font color="LEVEL">This day will come<br1>
In captivity distorted heaven<br1>
you do not hear the voice of the Gods.<br>
On the devastated land that was once United,<br1>
spills river of blood,<br1>
and on the cold ground down, following the wind, a half-breed,<br1>
which will be the noble hero.<br>
It will be lonely,<br1>
as a child of the wind, walk on an unpaved path.<br1>
And when you awake his noble blood,<br1>
he will lead You to the Sacred Cup.</font>

What You went looking for this device and returned it, was no accident.<br>
