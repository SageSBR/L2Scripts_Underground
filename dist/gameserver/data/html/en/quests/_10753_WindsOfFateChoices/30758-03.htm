Oh, so You sent Leach. Well. I like you. I feel that in future there will be a lot of changes. I have a feeling that You can affect the fate of the world.<br>
Yeah, back to Blood... somehow I have my things too much. Can't remember where did I put that Blood eve. Don't rummage around in my chests? Find 4 correct. One of them will be the Blood of eve. Isn't that right?<br>
Are you ready?<br>
