Hmm... You've already been in the Garden of Life and should know... 
Guess that someone - someone 
gathered all of these things in that place!<br>
Woke up even the characters that were forever locked away by the gods, and all were up to something. 
It happened in the Prison of Darkness. I think whoever manages them, and he 
behind all of this! Now, if You and your comrades went to Prison Exiles 
and investigated... That would be great!<br>
