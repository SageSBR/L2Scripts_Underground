 Grocer Vollodos:<br>
Have you ever been in the Village of the Dark Elves?<br>

and those who survived were forced to flee from the village. It is said that the epidemic has covered the entire continent.
See! You see the dark fog, which covered all around? I think that soon we will all come to an end.<br>
