 Grocer Vollodos:<br>
The epidemic has covered the entire continent. See! You see the dark fog, which covered all around?
If you roam around, you can get sick and die.<br>
Because of the special circumstances I can not leave this place, so I can not point you to the road.
I hope you manage to get to a safe place.<br>
(This quest is available after reaching level 85.)
