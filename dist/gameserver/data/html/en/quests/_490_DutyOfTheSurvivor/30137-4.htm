 Grocer Vollodos:<br>
We with a few surviving Dark Elves are now developing medicines.
But I'm not a scientist and not a magician, so little I can do ... All I can - extract
needed for research materials, killing monsters living nearby.<br>
My own strength is not enough to fight monsters, so I address
help from strangers passing by.<br>
