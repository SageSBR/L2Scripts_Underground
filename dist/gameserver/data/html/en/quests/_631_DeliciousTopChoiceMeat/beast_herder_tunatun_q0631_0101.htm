The meat of wild beasts is renowned for its succulence! From the clean taste of Kookaburra to the gamy taste of cougar, and Buffalo, with it's strong, musky taste...<br>
Unfortunately, there's no one left to raise and slaughter them... As they mature, they become ever more menacing and ferocious!<br>
None of us dare go near them!<br>
