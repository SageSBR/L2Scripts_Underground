<html><body>The High Priest of Prana:<br>
It seems to me that you are still not strong enough ... Trust you perform tasks outside the city until early. But I want to help you as quickly as possible to reveal your potential. You are capable of much. Now the most important thing - do not miss out on time, do not lose the chance.<br>
The job which I'll get to you at this time, will be the first test. Remember, you have to address as it is directly related to your future.<br>
