Soldier Plenos:<br>
        
Greetings ally!<br>
I suggest you a mission which can prove your strength. The mission is to hunt Dius, the Deadman of Destruction, and his subordinate Drakes over the skies of Seed of Destruction.<br>
For further instructions you should go and see Soldier Tenis, the injured soldier who's in the center of Keucereus Alliance Base, and ask for advice.<br>
