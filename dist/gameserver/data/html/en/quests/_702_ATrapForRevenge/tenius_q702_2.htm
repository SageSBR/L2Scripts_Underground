Soldier Tenius:<br>
        
Ah! Right.<br>
It's about that hunt of my life. I hope you will be able to help me.<br>
I got injured when went out to hunt Dius, but you cannot see Dius, the Deadman of Destruction, with an ordinary method.You should use the trap which I developed in order to lure Dius, the Deadman of Destruction.<br>
The trap requires good meat to work, so I need you to bring <font color="LEVEL">100 pieces of Drake's Flesh</font> to be used as materials by capturing his subordinate Drak, which appears over the skies of Seed of Destruction.<br>
Hunt <font color="LEVEL">Drak, Drake Wing, and Mutated Drake Wing</font> in the skies near Seed of Destruction. When you are done, come back to me.<br>
