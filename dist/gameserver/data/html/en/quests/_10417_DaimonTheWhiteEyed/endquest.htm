I'd have thought <font color="LEVEL">Daimon the White-eyed</font> would be too dangerous even for <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> to try and control. but he tried to resurrect him? Good thing you were there to stop him! I sure am glad <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus'</font> sent you to us!<br>Well, now I need to do my part for the <font color="LEVEL">Eye of Argos</font> and stop Embryo from bothering him. I guess I'm stuck here for a while. I do hope our paths cross again!</body></html>
