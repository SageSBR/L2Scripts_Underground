High Priest Sylvain:<br>
Hmm... This is unbelievable...<br>
The signs reported by many of our brethren signify the advent of an angel!<br>
Our man was investigating when and where the angel would come down to earth.<br>
Apparently, he found an eyewitness who claims to have actually seen the angel...<br>
If true, this means that Einhasad may be sending us another message, just as she did to Emperor Schuneimann long ago...<br>
