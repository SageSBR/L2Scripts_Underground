<html><head><body>Giant's Minion Lugonnes:<br>So direct. Let's see... You got rid of <font color="LEVEL">Belos</font>, as well as Chief Brakki of the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orcs</font>. That should break their alliance with <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>. Really impressivework there, I don't think there is anything left for us to do now. <br>But we cannot stop fighting <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>. Somehow, I just know they will be up to their old tricks before long. <br>I will report to <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> in detail regarding your acheivement. We will always remember your valor. Thank you.</body></html>
