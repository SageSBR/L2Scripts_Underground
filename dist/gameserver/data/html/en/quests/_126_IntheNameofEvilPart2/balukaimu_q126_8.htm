Balu Kaimu:<br>
From the midst of his storm of memories, Balu Kaimu has found the one that you will need most.<br>
It comes not from an Elrokian, but is actually a memory of the ax Gazkh about its owner. It seems that Gazkh frequently communicated spiritually with its owner.<br>
The memory ends with the Warrior's Song, an ancient Elrokian song of battle. The ending is the clearest part of the memory, so the song must have great significance.<br>
