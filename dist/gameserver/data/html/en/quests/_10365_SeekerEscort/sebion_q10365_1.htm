Huh? It's the King? How did you get here ... What? Daffy
King entrusted me? Ye gods! Just when I
hurt his leg ... Hmm ... (King whines.)
<br>
Although foot from me and hurt, but his hands still intact ...
I think I can save the King. Ah ... King here
very dangerous, you can not walk around anywhere,
do you understand? I hurt his leg, so for some time
I will not go round. You, too, have a rest,
OK? All right? (King barks in response.)
