Ah ... The trouble. There was only one. What does this mean?
I mean sleuths. At first there were 10 ... almost
all ate the local monsters, there is only one
dog.
<br>
The king, say hello. (Dog King welcomes
barking) What ... You need to save at least this
dog ... I can no longer see it. Help me,
I beg you. King, ask for help. Come on.
(King looks and whining piteously)
