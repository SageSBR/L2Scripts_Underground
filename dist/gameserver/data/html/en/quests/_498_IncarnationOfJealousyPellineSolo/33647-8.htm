 Kartia Researcher:<br>
And, just received a message from the captain 
Avant-Garde Aden Adolf. It Seems That You 
did a swell job. Not often seen 
the hero who could be entrusted with such 
service. Thank you very much.
If you can, come back tomorrow to help us 
free the Maze of Kartii from the demons. And this is 
a small thank-you from our Kingdom.
