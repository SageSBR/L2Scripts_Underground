Thank you! First you need to take animals to the Cave of Roses that they breathed the aroma. And then you need to collect 20 samples of animal blood. Of course, if someone gets in our way, destroy it. The most important thing is the samples. You can first destroy the animals, and then collect samples. I hope for You.
