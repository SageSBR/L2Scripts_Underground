You have collected the blood samples? Thank you! Nothing special happened during the job? What? Say, they fell asleep, the smell paralyzed them? Hmm, I even think such a thing could not.<br>
Well, okay. Anyway, I was right, thinking that the smell of the Cave Rose somehow affect animals. I will send these samples to Aden and will be asked to conduct research. Thank you!<br><br>
