I need Your help to find out the secret Gardeners for the control animals. Recently, I saw something. If there are uncontrollable animals, a Gardener takes them to the Cave of Roses. As soon as they inhale the aroma of roses, immediately become calm and fall asleep. I'm sure they are affected by the smell. For research you need to gather samples of blood of sleeping animals, step into this cave. Would like to see samples of produced by You.<br><br>
