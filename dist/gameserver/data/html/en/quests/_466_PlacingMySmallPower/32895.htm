 Fairy Hierarch Noeti Mimilead:<br>
Without end there are Huge Cocoons and even more angry Fairies... 
Corrupting Darkness to blame. Trees get sick from the poison. If the trees die, 
we have no more strength to fight the darkness.<br>
We are unable to stop the angry fairies, but at least the trees should be saved. I Tetrarch fairies, and it's my duty.<br>
Why did You come to me?<br>
