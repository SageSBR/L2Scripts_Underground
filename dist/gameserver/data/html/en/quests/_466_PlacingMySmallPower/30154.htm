 Hierarch Asterios:<br>
The mother of all living beings - the Tree of Life.<br>
For us, the Elves, <font color="LEVEL">the Tree of Life</font> represents the center of the universe, the beginning of the universe. 
The tree is very important to us. There is even a legend that we are made from its leaves.<br>
But now the Tree of Life is dying. Someday it really will wither and die. We must prevent it.<br>
