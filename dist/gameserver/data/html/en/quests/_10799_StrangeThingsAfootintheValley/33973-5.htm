<html><head><body>Namo:<br>The Valley of Dragons has its regions, and its southern part is much more dangerous North.
<br>For a start, You are better off in a less dangerous area of the North, to deal with the undead and the Dragon Clan. 
Head North of the Valley of Dragons and kill the following monsters: 
<font color="LEVEL"></font>Gymnodraco, Dragon-gargoyle, Black Dragon, emerald Dragon, 
Sand Dragon, The Leader Of The Suicide Squad, A Minion Of The Suicide Squad, Cave Servant Of The Arrows, 
Cave Servant Warrior, Metal Cave Servant, Iron Cave Servant and Headless Knight<font color="LEVEL">. 
Just </font>100 enemies.<br>I think before taking any measures, it is better to eliminate a constant source of danger.</body>
