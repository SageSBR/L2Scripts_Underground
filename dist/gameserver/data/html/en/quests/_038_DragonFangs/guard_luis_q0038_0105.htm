Guard Luis: <br>
Thanks to your help, the southern shoreline road is much Safer!<br>
Let me see the Feather Ornaments.<br>
Hmm... this one's odd. This is a very ominous tooth, not a normal Langk Lizardman decoration. There's something sinister here.<br>
Can you take this tooth to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Iris</font> of Einhazad Temple?<br>
