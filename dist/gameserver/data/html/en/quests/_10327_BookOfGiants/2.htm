I think I already told You about it. Have you forgotten?<br>
In the ye sagira found a book called "the War of gods and Giants", it contains information about the strength of Giants, the origin of their power, the monsters of the Era of Giants and the like.<br><br>
 Once they failed to steal this book, but I'm sure they'll try to do it again. We need to move the book in a safe place. I'll guard this place, to rascals are unable to get in. Could You help?<br>
