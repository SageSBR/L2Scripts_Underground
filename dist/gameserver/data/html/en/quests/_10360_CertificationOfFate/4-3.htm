When the Giants ended the era, all they
created, was buried along with them ... But
probably due to the fall of the island Esagira, monsters
with the Shining Stone instead of the heart and awakened
crawled into the light.

Someone Embryo after learning of the incident, began a quest
one of the most dangerous monsters, Sakuma ... He
found and raised him up, intending to use
monster in some of their goals. However, suffered
failure.
