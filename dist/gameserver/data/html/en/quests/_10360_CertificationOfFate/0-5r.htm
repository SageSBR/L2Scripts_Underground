<html><body>Grand Master Rains:
<br>
I've heard a lot about you from the Guardians wasteland. You
quickly destroyed Sakuma ... To be honest, I
amazed. I want to thank you on behalf of all
local residents. He was awakened by Sakuma Embryo
have not found, but I do not think you need much
worry about it.
<br>
Now I'll change your profession, as promised. But
first talk about professions to choose from that would
Do you understand the features of each.
<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> Treasure Seekers </font> basically use
daggers and can be proud of their fire
power while playing in a band. <font color="LEVEL"> Arrow </font> - very
strong profession that will help you during
precipitation for the defense, because they can attack
distance.
<br>
Tell me what profession you want to select.
