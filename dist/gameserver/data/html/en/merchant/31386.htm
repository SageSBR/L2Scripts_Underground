Trader Violet:<br>
What brings you to this dangerous and remote place, stranger? Don't let darkness fall on you here unless you want more adventure than you've bargained for! Evil spirits rule the night!<br>
What? You're here to trade?! Ha! That's a good one!<br>
This is a small village and you won't find any quality items here, that's for sure... But I suppose you'll find what you've come for.<br>
