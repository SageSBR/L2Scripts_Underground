Trader Ian:<br>
Welcome to the center of magic: the Ivory Tower!<br>
People now tend to think of the Ivory Tower primarily as a research institute, but it once was a powerful political faction that controlled the mainland. And where do you think all that accumulate knowledge and magic is stored? Right here in the Tower!<br>
If there is another earth-shaking crisis, look no further than the Ivory Tower for the solution -- and probably the cause!<br>
