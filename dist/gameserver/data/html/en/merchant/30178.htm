Trader Zenkin:<br>
Ah, come in, friend! Welcome to the most honest shop in Northern Aden.<br>
I hope you don't believe the rumors that I am wanted by the law, or an escapee from Elmore, or even a Timak Orc in disguise! What foolishness! But you don't look like the gullible type to me. Right?<br>
Anyway, have a look at all the uncommon and exquisite items I have to offer!<br>
