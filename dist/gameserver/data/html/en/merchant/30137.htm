Wait a minute, please. I still can't calm down... I think I live in some kind of nightmare. Good thing I managed to grab some things when I left the village. Otherwise I would hardly be able to make ends meet. Want to look at things? I'm sure You'll find something useful. It will be beneficial for both of us!<br>
