Trader Viktor:<br>
Welcome, customer! Did you also come here to hunt the Unicorn? Or the Prime? The Satyr? Whatever you're after, it's always a good idea to be properly outfitted.<br>
Dragon Valley, Enchanted Valley, the Forest of Mirrors, the Giants' Cave... You can't just stroll into any of those places like they're public parks!<br>
