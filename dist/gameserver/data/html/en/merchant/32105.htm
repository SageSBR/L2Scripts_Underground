Dinn:<br>
Are you looking for anything in particular? Oh, please don't be fooled just because I'm a merchant at a small wharf; I have a wide selection for you to choose from. If you see anything you can't live without, just say the word!<br>
What, nothing that makes your eyes widen with longing? Believe me, I cant offer everything you'll find on the mainland. Why don't you test me for yourself?<br>
