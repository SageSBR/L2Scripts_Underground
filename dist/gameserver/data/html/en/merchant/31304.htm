It is wise to be careful in your purchasing. Not everything that glitters is gold, after all! That is especially true for accessories. You cannot judge a book by its cover.<br>
In fact, that is even true for people. Do you see Mr. Kendis, the Dwarf? He may look like a child, but he's even older than me!<br>
